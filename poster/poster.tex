  {\large\textbf{Statement}}

  Get the flag from the following system:
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{samsara-protocol-black.png}
  \end{center}
  
  \vspace{-2em}
  \hhrule

  \vspace{-0.5em}
  {\large\textbf{Solution}}: First, analyze the system.
  We have two main parts, an LCG that give us data and a ZKP scheme.
  The idea is to be able to use the last one to recover the flag from this server.
  Let see each one separately.

  \vspace{0.5em}
  \textbf{Last part} (ZKP scheme)
  
  \vspace{-0.5em}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item It's similar to a non-interactive \textit{Girault's proof of knowledge} (with \textit{Fiat-Shamir transformation}).
      The idea is to be like an honest prover and create values that holds conditions $J_1$ and $J_2$.
    \item $h$ isn't used in hash and it's a weakness (\textit{Frozen Heart Vulnerability}).
    \item Choosing random values $u,z$, we have $e = \text{Hash}(g,n,u)$ and we aim for
      $h \equiv (u \cdot g^{-z})^{e_\text{inv}} \pmod{n}$ where $e_\text{inv} \equiv e^{-1} \pmod{\phi(n)}$
      because:

      \vspace{-1em}
      \begin{equation*}
        g^z \cdot h^e \equiv g^z \cdot \left((u \cdot g^{-z})^{e_\text{inv}}\right)^e \equiv g^z \cdot u \cdot g^{-z} \equiv u \pmod{n}
      \end{equation*}


      \vspace{-0.6em}
    \item We can compute $e_\text{inv}$ with \textit{Extended Euclidean algorithm} if we know
      $\phi(n)$.
      If it doesn't exist, try another $u,z$ random values.
    \item Sending these values to verifier, it should give us the flag message.
      So, from the first part we have to get $\phi(n)$ to solve this problem.
  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{-0.5em}
  \textbf{First part} (Linear Congruential Generator)

  \vspace{-0.5em}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item It's LCG with unknown parameters and are given non consecutive terms of
      this sequence (with its positions).
    \item Let be $s_k \! = \! f^{(k)}(s)$ the terms we have.
      An useful property to use is $s_A - s_B \equiv (a^A-a^B)\left(s+\frac{b}{a-1}\right)\pmod{p}$.
    \item Let $T \! = \! pX, S \! = \! pY$, then $\gcd(S,T) \! = \! p \! \iff \! \gcd(X,Y) \! = \! 1$.
      Since the probability that two random numbers are coprime is $61\%$,
      we have a good chance to get $p$ with a little quantity of $(T,S)$ tries.
    \item Aiming $R : R \! \neq \! 0 \land R \! \equiv \! 0 \pmod{p}$,
      we'll search for positions values $A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H \in \left\{\sum_{i=0}^k M_i\right\}_{k=0}^{\# M}$ such that:
      \begin{equation*}
          0 \equiv (s_A-s_B)(s_C-s_D)-(s_E-s_F)(s_G-s_H)
            \equiv B^2 K\pmod{p}
      \end{equation*}
      where $B = s+\frac{b}{a-1}, K = (a^A-a^B)(a^C-a^D)-(a^E-a^F)(a^G-a^H)$.
    \item Since $B \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$ is unlikely to happen, we aim for $p|K$. For that:
      \begin{equation*}
        \{A+C,B+D\} = \{E+G,F+H\} \land \{A+D,B+C\} = \{E+H,F+G\}
      \end{equation*}

      \vspace{-0.8em}
    \item Let $m = \#M + 1$. The search can be done with bruteforce in $O(m^8)$,
      but searching intelligently in $O(m^6)$.
      The total number of useful combinations is $288$ and we're able 
      to get $p$ and also $q = \frac{n}{p}$.
      So, we finally get $\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$.
